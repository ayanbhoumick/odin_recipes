    <h2>Description</h2>

    <!--Main Body-->
    <p>Shahi Paneer is not just a dish—it's an experience, a luxurious journey through the royal kitchens of India's glorious past. Originating from the rich culinary traditions of the Mughal Empire, the word “Shahi” literally translates to “royal,” and paneer is the beloved Indian cottage cheese. Together, they create a dish that's revered across the Indian subcontinent for its creamy texture, aromatic spices, and indulgent flavor.

    At its core, Shahi Paneer is made by simmering soft cubes of paneer in a silky, rich gravy that typically includes tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, cream, and a generous mix of Indian spices. But what truly sets this dish apart is the use of ground cashews or almonds, which lend a nutty sweetness and luxurious thickness to the gravy, giving it that signature royal mouthfeel. A splash of cream or milk is added at the end to elevate its richness and give it a beautiful, velvety finish.</p>
    
    <h3>The Flavour Profile</h3>

    <p>Shahi Paneer isn't meant to be fiery or overpoweringly spicy. Instead, it carries a mild, aromatic profile—deep and complex, with hints of sweetness from the nuts and a subtle heat from spices like garam masala, cardamom, and cumin. It's the perfect balance of savory and sweet, rich but not overwhelming, indulgent yet comforting.</p>

    <h3>Royal Roots</h3>

    <p>Back in the day, dishes like Shahi Paneer were served to royalty in grand feasts, garnished with slivers of gold or silver leaf (varak) and paired with lavish breads like naan or kulcha. While the modern home cook might skip the edible bling, the essence of opulence still remains in every bite. Even today, Shahi Paneer is a star dish in weddings, celebrations, and high-end Indian restaurants.</p>

    <h3>How it's served</h3>

    <p>Shahi Paneer is best enjoyed with buttery naan, tandoori roti, or steamed basmati rice. The rich gravy clings to every grain or piece of bread, making every mouthful satisfying and flavorful. Some like to top it with fresh coriander leaves, a swirl of cream, or even fried onions for added texture and depth.</p>

    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>

    <p>In many Indian households, Shahi Paneer is a weekend special—a reward after a long week, or the centerpiece of a Sunday lunch with the fam. It's the kind of dish that brings people to the table, eager for seconds (and thirds).</p>
