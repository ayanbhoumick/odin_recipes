    <h2>Description</h2>

    <!--Main Body-->
    <p>Butter Chicken is a rich, creamy, and slightly smoky North Indian curry made from grilled or tandoori chicken that's simmered in a luscious tomato, butter, and cream-based gravy. It was accidentally invented in the 1950s at Moti Mahal Restaurant in Delhi, when leftover tandoori chicken was tossed into a tomato-butter-cream sauce to avoid food waste—and boom, culinary history was made.

    Now it'’'s a global legend. You'’'ll find it in fine dining restaurants, street food joints, weddings, takeouts, and even on airplane menus. It'’'s the dish that converts curry-haters into curry-addicts.
    
    <h3>What makes it special?</h3>
    <p>The magic of Butter Chicken lies in the balance. It'’'s rich but not greasy, spicy but not fiery, tangy but not sour. Unlike many Indian curries, this one has a smooth, velvety texture with a hint of sweetness that perfectly complements the bold spices and charred flavor of the chicken.

    And let's not forget the holy trio:</p>

        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Smoked tandoori chicken</li>
